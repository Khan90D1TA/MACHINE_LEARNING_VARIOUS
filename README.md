# 1) ML_KHAN : 

Overview
This notebook covers fundamental concepts and questions related to the sigmoid activation function and a practical application using the HR dataset to predict employee turnover. The primary topics include:

# Part 1: Sigmoid Function

Sigmoid Function Output Range:

Explanation of why the output of the sigmoid function ($\sigma$) lies within the interval (0, 1).
Discussion on how the sigmoid function outputs can be interpreted as probabilities.

Sigmoid Function Output Limits:
Analysis of why the output of the sigmoid function can never be exactly 0 or 1.

Part 2: HR Dataset Analysis and Prediction

Objective
Using the HR.csv dataset, consider the column "left" as the target variable where "1" means the person left the company and "0" means the person did not leave the company.

Steps
Data Exploration:
Investigate how given features affect the target variable "left" using various graphs and charts.

Model Building:
Select several relevant features.
Build a logistic regression model using sklearn to predict the target variable "left".

Model Evaluation:
Discuss the model performance using the confusion matrix and the classification report on the test set.
